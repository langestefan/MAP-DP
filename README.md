# MAP-DP
MAP-DP clustering algorithm.

I am NOT the owner of this amazing algorithm, this is just a way to archive this code to easily integrate it into my own projects.

## Examples
I have included some examples with different data and settings to illustrate how well the algorithm works. I share the visualizations here below:
